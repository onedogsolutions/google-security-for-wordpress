/**
 * Fluent Forms Provider
 *
 * Makes this plugin the reCAPTCHA implementation for Fluent Forms, to the same
 * specification as GSWP_Provider_Gravity_Forms.
 *
 * Like the Gravity Forms provider, it NEVER switches Fluent Forms' own captcha
 * off and never writes to a Fluent Forms option. Detection drives the coverage
 * report and the operator notice; retiring the host plugin's captcha is the
 * operator's action. Reads of Fluent Forms' settings go straight to the
 * database rather than through get_option(), so nothing this plugin does can
 * colour what it reports about another plugin.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * VERIFICATION STATUS
 *
 * Every binding in this file has been read directly from installed source:
 * Fluent Forms 6.2.9 (free) and Fluent Forms Pro 6.2.7. Nothing here should
 * be treated as verified for a different major version — 2.23.1 shipped a
 * defect that traced back to exactly that assumption (an option's TYPE
 * outliving the version it was confirmed against; see raw_option()).
 *
 * `FluentForm\App\Modules\Form\FormHandler::onSubmit()` is DEAD CODE — the
 * live AJAX submission path is
 * `SubmissionHandler::submit() -> SubmissionHandlerService::handleSubmission()`
 * (app/Hooks/Ajax.php). Do not re-derive a binding from onSubmit(); it is
 * commented out at its only call site and none of its behaviour runs.
 *
 * Every host-plugin binding below still fails to the pessimistic answer where
 * source did not settle the question outright:
 *
 *   - a form we cannot inspect is ineligible, so we do not claim to cover it;
 *   - a form we cannot classify is treated as a PAYMENT form, so it fails
 *     closed rather than silently fails open on a real payment;
 *   - a User Registration feed row we cannot decode is treated as 'create',
 *     the stricter reading (account_feed_type() now reads the verified feed
 *     shape first and falls back to this only when no feed row parses);
 *   - unreadable billing mappings yield no transactionData, which
 *     GSWP_Verifier already degrades to a plain score rather than an API error.
 *
 * Three Fluent Forms specifics carry more weight than any hook name:
 *
 *   1. SUBMISSION TRANSPORT. Fluent Forms submits over AJAX and serialises the
 *      form into a single request parameter. VERIFIED:
 *      SubmissionHandlerService::prepareHandler() filters $formData down to
 *      registered fields plus a fixed allow-list
 *      (Helper::getWhiteListedFields()) before it ever reaches the
 *      validation filter — an unregistered, unwhitelisted key is dropped.
 *      register_hooks() therefore whitelists TOKEN_FIELD via
 *      fluentform/white_listed_fields (whitelist_token_field()), which is
 *      what makes submitted_token()'s first transport genuinely work rather
 *      than assumed to. Reading the token from the request is fine — it is
 *      request data. What is never request-derived is the ENFORCEMENT
 *      DECISION: form_is_strict() reads the stored form definition, so a
 *      caller cannot opt out by omitting a field (the bypass class removed
 *      in 2.17.0).
 *
 *   2. REJECTION VISIBILITY. Fluent Forms attaches validation errors to keys,
 *      and VERIFIED: any key that resolves to no field in the DOM is
 *      rendered through its error-stack fallback under both
 *      `errorMessagePlacement` settings (assets/js/form-submission.js). Our
 *      token field IS a resolvable key, and attaching a rejection to it
 *      renders nothing — the opposite of the earlier assumption. reject()
 *      therefore uses a deliberately unresolvable key (see ERROR_KEY), which
 *      Fluent Forms itself does for its own form-level errors ('restricted').
 *
 *   3. NO WHOLE-MARKUP FILTER. Fluent Forms has no equivalent of
 *      gform_get_form_filter, so the coverage backstop is a gated output
 *      buffer. VERIFIED: FormBuilder::render() wraps its own body in
 *      ob_start()/ob_get_clean() with the two render actions always paired
 *      inside it, which is why the nesting-level guard in
 *      close_backstop_buffer() has held. It only opens for a form whose
 *      primary injection point has already been observed to miss, and it
 *      refuses to close a buffer it does not own.

	 * plugin's validation runs — if one did, a server-side rejection here
	 * would stop the order but leave a hold standing on the customer's card.
	 *
	 * VERIFIED against every gateway shipped by Fluent Forms and Fluent
	 * Forms Pro 6.2.7: none does.
	 *  - Server side, every gateway charges from
	 *    fluentform/process_payment_{method}, dispatched by
	 *    PaymentHandler::maybeHandlePayment() on
	 *    fluentform/before_insert_payment_form — which runs AFTER
	 *    SubmissionHandlerService::handleValidation(). There is no charge
	 *    path that precedes this filter.
	 *  - Stripe Inline and Square Inline tokenise client-side
	 *    (createPaymentMethod / card.tokenize()); Square's follow-on
	 *    verifyBuyer() is a 3-D Secure CHALLENGE that yields a verification
	 *    token, not a charge or a hold.
	 *  - Authorize.Net's card-entry modal, and Paddle/Paystack/RazorPay's
	 *    equivalents, carry a submission_id/transaction_hash in their
	 *    config and so cannot open until the submission is already
	 *    accepted.
	 *  - PayPal Inline's button submits our form FIRST — its onClick handler
	 *    calls $form.trigger('submit') and does not call createOrder until
	 *    that promise resolves — and explicitly REJECTS that promise on
	 *    fluentform_validation_failed, so a rejection here means no PayPal
	 *    order is ever created.
	 *
	 * Leaving this false now would be the wrong default: gswp_txn_block is a
	 * switch an operator sets deliberately, on a site that also has
	 * Enterprise keys and Transaction Defense on, and silently vetoing it
	 * while logging that nothing was blocked is the plugin doing less than
	 * asked while reporting that it complied.
	 *
	 * Two residuals worth naming rather than hiding behind "false is safer":
	 * on Square Inline the buyer may complete a 3-D Secure challenge before
	 * we reject — an annoyance, not a charge, since the verification token
	 * simply goes unused; and a gateway added by a third-party add-on is
	 * outside everything read here. gswp_ff_txn_block_allowed is now the
