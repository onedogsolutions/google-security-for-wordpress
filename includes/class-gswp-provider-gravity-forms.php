/**
 * Gravity Forms Provider
 *
 * Makes this plugin the reCAPTCHA implementation for Gravity Forms: when the
 * provider is on, every eligible form is scored here.
 *
 * It does NOT switch Gravity Forms' own reCAPTCHA off. Until 2.21.0 it did, by
 * filtering the add-on's stored settings so they read as unconfigured. The
 * add-on's settings screen reads that option to populate its fields and saves
 * back what it read, so it wrote the filtered blanks to disk and destroyed the
 * stored keys on a live site. Detection of GF's reCAPTCHA remains — it drives
 * the coverage report and the operator notice — but retiring it is the
 * operator's action, not ours.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * VERIFICATION STATUS
 *
 * The Gravity Forms bindings below (hook names, feed meta keys, native-captcha
 * option names) were written WITHOUT the installed Gravity Forms source to hand
 * and are marked individually. Writing GF integration code from assumption is
 * the defect that produced the 2.16.0 Stripe outage, so every host-plugin call
 * here is guarded and fails to the pessimistic answer:
 *
 *   - an unrecognised captcha state returns 'unknown', never 'off';
 *   - a form we cannot inspect is ineligible, so we do not claim to cover it;
 *   - a form we cannot classify is treated as a PAYMENT form, so it fails
 *     closed rather than silently fails open on a real payment;
 *   - unreadable transaction mappings yield no transactionData, which
 *     GSWP_Verifier already degrades to a plain score rather than an API error.
 *
 * Since 2.20.0 there is no staged rollout to catch a bad binding over time, so
 * two mechanisms carry that weight instead:
 *
 *   - inject_into_markup() injects into the finished form HTML whenever the
 *     primary hook did not, so coverage does not depend on having guessed the
 *     render paths correctly;
 *   - validate_submission() refuses to penalise a submission for a form we have
 *     no record of injecting into, and reports it as a coverage gap instead.
 *
 * Reads of Gravity Forms' own settings are for reporting only, and go straight
 * to the database rather than through get_option(), so nothing this plugin does
 * can colour what it reports about another plugin.

	 * carries a browser-minted token.
	 *
	 * This plugin had no concept of that, and the consequences all pointed the
	 * wrong way: the coverage report showed a permanent "no token seen yet" state
	 * with the un-actionable instruction to load the form on the front end, and

	 * Listing a form here suppresses the missing-token alarm for it: no coverage
	 * gap, no error log line, no operator email. That is ALL it does.
